# Design Documentation

The first step I did was to take the feedback I received from A3 and iterate it into my prototype.

# A3 Web Proposal Feedback
  * __Pages__, There was too many pages in my prototype and I wanted to simplify this down just to the important features needed. I decided to cut down the stories section as I felt like the other pages of resources, articles, and about us, membership targetted the user profiles more. I also decided to put in the membership f
  * __Navigation Bar__, the feedback I got given was the navigation bar wasn't clear - I decided to redesign this and make it more clear and bigger to call to attention.
  * __Membership Form__, I decided to remove some of the items asked in the membership form as it could always be tailored later on and was a barrier to entry for a user having too many inputs. 


**Home/Landing Page:**

**About us:**

**Resources:**

**Stories:**

**Membership Page:**

**Membership form:**

I then had a session where I got my peers in my class to look over my work and provide me feedback in which they said:
> "Make sure you have back buttons so users can easily navigate back"

> "Highlight the navigation bar more so people can easily see it - it blends in with the white a bit."

> "the sparkles may be hard to make responsive and the mobile version so consider simplify it as you cannot use javascript."

I then took this to figma along with some other self reflection. 
  * __Colours__, The gradient wouldn't be possible to make so I removed them as they didn't look good to be extended out. I should change each to solid colours. 


# Iteration 1
Before starting coding I decided to utilise the feedback I got from my tutor to produce the following. 

**New Home Page:**

**Membership Page:**

**Resources & About Us page:**

# Challenges
* __Fact & Fiction__ I couldn't actually code in what happens when you click on fact and fiction - so I left that as it is. It is meant to show up with right/wrong and a new fact is provided is provided. 

# Reflection
This entire assignment was extremely challenging as so many features on  my website/figma prototype had to be taken into consideration when actually coding. It allowed me to understand that sometimes features that may add to the aesthetic can't  be coded in as it will actually end up ruining the user experience especially if it is not responsive. By doing this is actually made the UI alot more simple. 

Alot of other features that were hard to code were unusual shaping of pictures/graphics which I ended up creating a graphic for them vs actually coding it in as it couldn't be done. Gradients and other shapes also couldn't be added in. 

I had to revisit the heuristics by Norman Nielson alot to remember that it was key for usability and it was very important to hit each and everyone on of them. I also got informal feedback from friendly and family with the system usbaility score and asked them which bits were nice. It was hard to actually card out usability testing as there was no coding on the backend.
